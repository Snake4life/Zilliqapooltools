Tools to augment CMAX Proxy

I'm closing down my zilliqa pools, so this is my conribution to the community.

With the items in this repo you can:

automatically update nodes remotely upon software change (from windows)
get your addr and private keys
automatically pay miners using nodejs and zilliqa-js every block if your using CMAX proxy.

Credits go to the following repos:

https://github.com/DurianStallSingapore/Zilliqa-Mining-Proxy
https://github.com/nnamon

P.S I am not a programmer, so excuse the the formatting and use of varibiables.

Enjoy!
